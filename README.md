Fine-Tuning GPT-2 and LLaMA BERT Models for Text Summarization
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning GPT-2 and LLaMA BERT models for the task of text summarization. The goal is to use pre-trained language models and adapt them to produce coherent and concise summaries for different types of input texts.

Overview
Text summarization is a critical task in natural language processing that involves condensing long documents into shorter summaries while retaining key information. This project utilizes two state-of-the-art models—GPT-2 and LLaMA BERT—fine-tuned on a summarization dataset to achieve better performance in this task.

Models Used
GPT-2: A transformer-based model trained for natural language generation tasks, fine-tuned for abstractive summarization.
LLaMA BERT: A variant of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) fine-tuned for extractive summarization.
